# Controller board

This is the first version of the controller board.
It's a 100mmx100mm 4 layer PCB.

An interactive bom is provided inside ibom folder.
Grbl files are in production folder together with a BOM file. Some LCSC components code are provided for reference.

The board was manufactured at JLCPCB.

## ToDo

Ground trace in TMC2209 is not connected to both ground vias but just to one. After testing this doesn't seems a problem.
