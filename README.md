# AntennaRotator
This is an improved antenna rotor based on [Satnogs Project rotor V3.1](https://wiki.satnogs.org/SatNOGS_Rotator_v3). It uses the same mechanics but a different custom made controller.

The board uses an ARM based microcontroller (SAMD21) at 48MHz, giving more headroom for future developements. It uses the Arduino Zero core to ease the programming stage. 
TMC2209 are used as drivers to provide a silent experience.
